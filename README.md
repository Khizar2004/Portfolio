# Khizar's 3D Interactive Portfolio

This is my personal 3D portfolio website that showcases my work and skills through an immersive digital workspace environment. I designed this space to reflect my passion for blending technology with creative design, creating an experience that's both functional and visually engaging.

## About This Project

I built this portfolio using React and Three.js to create an interactive 3D environment that visitors can explore. The workspace metaphor allows for natural discovery of my projects, skills, and background through interacting with various objects on the desk.
